## What you will learn

- How the OpenClaw adapter connects to ISCL Core
- How to configure OpenClaw skills to use Clavion for signing
- How to run the full demo stack with Docker Compose
- How to write a custom OpenClaw skill that uses Clavion

## Overview

The `@clavion/adapter-openclaw` package provides thin skill wrappers that translate OpenClaw's skill interface into ISCL TxIntents. When an OpenClaw agent invokes a crypto skill, the adapter constructs a TxIntent and sends it to ISCL Core via the `ISCLClient`.

```text
OpenClaw Agent
    ↓ skill invocation
@clavion/adapter-openclaw (Domain A)
    ↓ HTTP (ISCLClient)
@clavion/core (Domain B)
    ↓ policy → approval → signing → broadcast
Blockchain
```

## Step 1: Start the Docker Compose stack

The easiest way to run OpenClaw + Clavion together is the Docker Compose demo stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml --profile demo up -d
```

This starts three services:

| Service | Port | Role |
|---------|------|------|
| `anvil` | 8545 | Local Base fork (Anvil) |
| `iscl-core` | 3100 | ISCL Core API |
| `openclaw` | -- | OpenClaw agent with Clavion skills |

Verify all services are running:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml ps
```

## Step 2: Verify connectivity

Check that ISCL Core is healthy:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3100/v1/health
```

Check that the OpenClaw agent can reach ISCL Core:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml logs openclaw | head -20
```

You should see the ISCLClient health check succeeding on startup.

## Step 3: Run a demo transfer

The demo stack includes a pre-configured transfer script:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/demo-transfer.ts
```

This script:
1. Constructs a TxIntent for a USDC transfer on the Anvil fork
2. Sends it through the OpenClaw skill wrapper
3. Passes through ISCL's pipeline (policy, simulation, approval, signing)
4. Broadcasts to the Anvil fork
5. Verifies the on-chain balance change

## Step 4: Run a demo swap

```bash
npx tsx scripts/demo-swap.ts
```

This executes a WETH → USDC swap through Uniswap V3 on the Anvil fork.

## Writing a custom OpenClaw skill

An OpenClaw skill that uses Clavion follows this pattern:

```javascript
// SKILL.md defines the skill interface for OpenClaw
// run.mjs implements the skill logic

import { ISCLClient } from "@clavion/adapter-openclaw";

const client = new ISCLClient({
  baseUrl: process.env.ISCL_API_URL || "http://localhost:3100",
});

// Build a TxIntent
const intent = {
  version: "1",
  id: crypto.randomUUID(),
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  chain: { type: "evm", chainId: 8453 },
  wallet: { address: process.env.ISCL_WALLET_ADDRESS },
  action: {
    type: "transfer",
    asset: { kind: "erc20", address: "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913" },
    to: recipientAddress,
    amount: amountInWei,
  },
  constraints: {
    maxGasWei: "1000000000000000",
    deadline: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 3600,
    maxSlippageBps: 0,
  },
  metadata: { source: "openclaw-adapter" },
};

// Execute the secure pipeline
const approval = await client.txApproveRequest(intent);
if (approval.approved) {
  const result = await client.txSignAndSend({
    intent,
    approvalTokenId: approval.approvalTokenId,
  });
  console.log(`TX: ${result.txHash}`);
}
```

## Verification

<Check>Docker Compose stack starts with all three services healthy</Check>
<Check>Demo transfer script completes and tokens move on Anvil</Check>
<Check>Demo swap script completes with WETH → USDC exchange</Check>
<Check>Audit trail shows all events correlated by intent ID</Check>
