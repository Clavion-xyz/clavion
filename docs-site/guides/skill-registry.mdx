## Overview

The Skill Registry manages the full lifecycle of skill manifests -- from creation through registration, validation, and revocation. It ensures that only verified, integrity-checked, and statically scanned skills can execute against ISCL Core.

Every skill that wants to interact with the ISCL API must first be registered. Registration runs a **6-step validation pipeline** that checks schema conformance, cryptographic signature, file integrity, and static analysis before persisting the skill in a SQLite database.

<Note>
Revoked skills are soft-deleted and excluded from active listings but preserved for audit purposes.
</Note>

**Key source files:**

## SkillManifest v1 schema

Every skill package includes a `SkillManifest` JSON document describing its identity, permissions, sandbox constraints, and content-addressed files.

```typescript
interface SkillManifest {
  version: "1";                    // Schema version, always "1"
  name: string;                    // Unique identifier: lowercase, digits, hyphens
                                   // Pattern: ^[a-z0-9-]+$, max 64 chars
  publisher: {
    name: string;                  // Human-readable publisher name
    address: string;               // Ethereum address of signer (0x-prefixed, 40 hex chars)
    contact: string;               // Publisher email (validated as email format)
  };
  permissions: {
    txActions: Array<              // Requested transaction action types
      "transfer" | "approve" | "swap_exact_in" | "swap_exact_out"
    >;
    chains: number[];              // Chain IDs the skill operates on (e.g., [1, 8453])
    networkAccess: boolean;        // Whether the skill needs outbound network
    filesystemAccess: boolean;     // Whether the skill needs filesystem writes
  };
  sandbox: {
    memoryMb: number;              // Memory limit (1-512 MB)
    timeoutMs: number;             // Execution timeout (1000-60000 ms)
    allowSpawn: boolean;           // Whether child process spawning is permitted
  };
  files: Array<{
    path: string;                  // Relative path within skill package
    sha256: string;                // SHA-256 hash (lowercase hex, 64 chars)
  }>;                              // At least 1 file entry required
  signature: string;               // ECDSA signature (0x-prefixed hex)
}
```

<Note>
The JSON Schema uses `additionalProperties: false` on all objects. No undocumented fields are accepted. AJV runs in strict mode with all errors reported.
</Note>

## Creating a manifest

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define skill metadata">
    Choose a unique name (lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens), declare the publisher identity, and specify the permissions your skill requires:

    ```json
    {
      "version": "1",
      "name": "my-defi-skill",
      "publisher": {
        "name": "Acme DeFi",
        "address": "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678",
        "contact": "dev@acme-defi.example"
      },
      "permissions": {
        "txActions": ["swap_exact_in", "transfer"],
        "chains": [1, 8453],
        "networkAccess": false,
        "filesystemAccess": false
      },
      "sandbox": {
        "memoryMb": 128,
        "timeoutMs": 30000,
        "allowSpawn": false
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hash all skill files">
    Compute the SHA-256 hash of every source file in your skill package. Hashes must be lowercase hex strings (64 characters, no `0x` prefix):

    ```bash
    sha256sum src/run.mjs src/helpers.mjs
    # Output:
    # a1b2c3d4...  src/run.mjs
    # e5f6a7b8...  src/helpers.mjs
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add file entries to manifest">
    Add each file with its relative path and computed hash:

    ```json
    {
      "files": [
        { "path": "src/run.mjs", "sha256": "a1b2c3d4..." },
        { "path": "src/helpers.mjs", "sha256": "e5f6a7b8..." }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign the manifest">
    Signing uses three operations in sequence:

    1. **Remove** the `signature` field from the manifest object
    2. **JCS canonicalize** the remaining object (RFC 8785 -- deterministic JSON serialization)
    3. **keccak256** hash the canonical JSON bytes
    4. **ECDSA sign** the hash with the publisher's private key

    ```typescript
    import { signManifest } from "@clavion/registry";

    const unsigned = {
      version: "1" as const,
      name: "my-defi-skill",
      publisher: { /* ... */ },
      permissions: { /* ... */ },
      sandbox: { /* ... */ },
      files: [ /* ... */ ],
    };

    const signed = await signManifest(unsigned, "0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY");
    // signed.signature is now populated with a 0x-prefixed ECDSA signature
    ```

    The `signManifest()` function handles the full pipeline: it strips the signature field, JCS-canonicalizes the rest, computes `keccak256`, and signs using `viem/accounts`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Registration pipeline

When you submit a manifest to `POST /v1/skills/register`, the `SkillRegistryService` runs a 6-step validation pipeline. Every step must pass for registration to succeed. Failure at any step short-circuits the pipeline and returns an error response.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Schema validation">
    ```text
    validateManifest(manifest) -> ValidationResult
    ```

    Validates the manifest against `SkillManifestSchema` using AJV in strict mode with `allErrors: true`. Checks required fields, types, patterns, value ranges, and rejects any `additionalProperties`.

    **On failure:** Returns `schema_validation_failed` with an array of `validationErrors` (each containing `path` and `message`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Signature verification">
    ```text
    verifyManifest(manifest) -> boolean
    ```

    Verifies the ECDSA signature matches the declared publisher address:

    1. Remove the `signature` field from the manifest
    2. JCS-canonicalize the remaining object
    3. Compute `keccak256` of the canonical JSON
    4. Recover the signer address from the signature using `viem.recoverAddress()`
    5. Compare recovered address to `manifest.publisher.address` (case-insensitive)

    **On failure:** Returns `signature_verification_failed`. This means the manifest was either tampered with after signing or signed with a different key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="File hash verification">
    ```text
    verifyFileHashes(basePath, manifest.files) -> { valid, mismatches }
    ```

    Reads each file from disk (resolved relative to `basePath`), computes its SHA-256 hash, and compares against the hash declared in the manifest. Files that cannot be read are also treated as mismatches.

    **On failure:** Returns `file_hash_mismatch` with a `hashMismatches` array listing the paths that failed verification.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Static analysis">
    ```text
    scanFiles(basePath, filePaths) -> ScanReport
    ```

    Scans every file listed in the manifest for suspicious patterns. Each source file is read line-by-line and tested against 5 scan rules. The scan **fails** if any finding has `error` severity. Warnings are reported but do not block registration.

    **On failure:** Returns `static_scan_failed` with a `scanFindings` array containing each finding's file, line number, rule ID, severity, and message.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Duplicate check">
    ```text
    isRegistered(name) -> boolean
    ```

    Checks if a skill with the same name is already registered and active in the database. A previously revoked skill with the same name does **not** block re-registration (the check queries `status = 'active'` only).

    **On failure:** Returns `duplicate_skill` with HTTP 409 Conflict.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Database insert">
    If all checks pass, the skill is persisted to SQLite:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO registered_skills
      (name, publisher_address, publisher_name, manifest, manifest_hash, status, registered_at)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 'active', ?)
    ```

    The `manifest_hash` is the `keccak256` of the JCS-canonicalized manifest (without the signature field). An audit event `skill_registered` is logged with the skill name, manifest hash, and publisher address.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Static scanner rules

The static scanner runs 5 pattern-based rules against every source file. Each rule has one or more regex patterns and a severity level.

| Rule ID | Severity | Patterns Detected | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| `dynamic_eval` | error | `eval()`, `new Function()` | Dynamic code execution -- allows arbitrary code injection |
| `child_process` | error | `child_process`, `exec()`, `spawn()`, `execFile()`, `execSync()`, `spawnSync()` | Process spawning -- could escape sandbox |
| `network_access` | error | `fetch()`, `require('http')`, `http.`, `https.`, `net.`, `dgram.`, `WebSocket`, `XMLHttpRequest` | Unauthorized network access -- skills must not make direct network calls |
| `fs_write` | warning | `writeFileSync`, `writeFile`, `mkdirSync`, `unlinkSync`, `rmSync` | Filesystem writes -- reported but does not block registration |
| `obfuscation` | warning | Hex escape sequences (`\x` chains), `atob()`, `Buffer.from(..., 'base64')` | Potentially obfuscated code -- reported for manual review |

<Tip>
The scan passes if there are zero `error`-severity findings. Warning-severity findings are included in the response but do not prevent registration. Only the first matching pattern per rule per line is reported.
</Tip>

## Registration errors

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Condition | How to Fix |
|------------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| `schema_validation_failed` | 400 | Manifest does not conform to SkillManifest v1 schema | Check `validationErrors` in the response for specific field issues |
| `signature_verification_failed` | 400 | ECDSA signature does not match `publisher.address` | Re-sign with the correct private key matching `publisher.address` |
| `file_hash_mismatch` | 400 | SHA-256 of one or more files does not match manifest entries | Re-hash files and update `files` array, or re-sign after changes |
| `static_scan_failed` | 400 | Source files contain error-severity patterns | Remove flagged patterns (see `scanFindings` for file, line, and rule) |
| `duplicate_skill` | 409 | A skill with the same name is already active | Revoke the existing skill first, then re-register |

<Note>
All registration failures are audit-logged as `skill_registration_failed` events with the skill name and error reason.
</Note>

### GET /v1/skills

List all active (non-revoked) skills ordered by registration time.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "my-defi-skill",
    "publisherAddress": "0x1234...5678",
    "publisherName": "Acme DeFi",
    "manifest": { },

### DELETE /v1/skills/:name

Revoke a skill (soft delete). Sets `status` to `"revoked"` and records the `revoked_at` timestamp. The skill is excluded from `GET /v1/skills` listings but remains in the database for audit purposes.

```json
{ "revoked": true, "name": "my-defi-skill" }
```

Returns `404` if the skill does not exist or is already revoked. An audit event `skill_revoked` is logged with the skill name.

## Skill lifecycle

```text
                  6-step pipeline
  Created  ───────────────────────>  Active  ───────>  Revoked
  (manifest JSON)                   (in DB)         (soft delete)
                                      |
                                      v
                              Listed in GET /v1/skills
                              Executable by sandbox
```

- **Created:** A signed manifest JSON exists but has not been submitted to the registry.
- **Active:** The manifest passed all 6 validation steps and is stored in the database. Active skills appear in `GET /v1/skills` and can be executed by the sandbox runner.
- **Revoked:** The skill was soft-deleted via `DELETE /v1/skills/:name`. It no longer appears in active listings but its record persists in the database. A new skill with the same name can be registered after revocation.

## Security considerations

The Skill Registry sits at the boundary between Domain A (untrusted agent skills) and Domain B (trusted core). Four mechanisms provide defense in depth:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Signature Binding">
    The ECDSA signature ties the manifest to a specific publisher Ethereum address. Tampering with any field (including file hashes) invalidates the signature at Step 2.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Content Addressing">
    SHA-256 file hashes ensure that the exact code reviewed during registration is the code that runs in the sandbox. Any modification after registration is detectable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Static Scanning">
    The 5-rule scanner catches common sandbox escape patterns (eval, process spawning, direct network access). This is a defense-in-depth measure -- the sandbox itself also enforces isolation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Audit Trail">
    All registration successes, failures, and revocations are logged to the append-only audit trace, correlated by skill name and manifest hash.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
