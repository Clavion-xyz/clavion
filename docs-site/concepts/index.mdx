description: Understand the mental model behind Clavion -- trust domains, transaction lifecycle, policy enforcement, and approval flows.

## What you will learn

- How Clavion's architecture provides key isolation through trust domains
- The complete transaction execution pipeline
- How policy rules control what transactions are allowed
- How the approval model balances security with automation

## Concept map

Clavion's security model rests on four foundational concepts:

    System components, package layout, and how they interconnect.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trust Domains" icon="shield-halved" href="/concepts/trust-domains">
    The three-domain isolation model that keeps keys safe from untrusted code.

  <Card title="Transaction Lifecycle" icon="arrows-spin" href="/concepts/transaction-lifecycle">
    Every step from intent submission to on-chain confirmation.

  <Card title="Policy Engine" icon="gavel" href="/concepts/policy-engine">
    Configurable rules that decide which transactions are allowed, denied, or require approval.

## Design philosophy

Clavion is intentionally conservative:

- **Closed action set.** Only five transaction types are supported (transfer, transfer_native, approve, swap_exact_in, swap_exact_out). No arbitrary calldata signing.
- **Fail-closed defaults.** The default policy denies all value-bearing transactions. You must explicitly configure limits.
- **Defense in depth.** Multiple independent enforcement layers (schema validation, policy engine, preflight simulation, approval flow, audit trail) ensure no single failure compromises the system.
- **Intent, not execution.** Agents express what they want to do. Clavion decides how (and whether) to do it.
