## What you will learn

This section provides reference material for developers integrating with or operating Clavion. It is organized for lookup, not for learning -- see [Concepts](/concepts/index) for explanations and [Guides](/guides/index) for walkthroughs.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are served at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3100
```

The API is bound to localhost only. See [ADR-004](/concepts/architecture) for the rationale.

## Authentication

No authentication is required. Access control is enforced by the localhost binding (only local processes can connect) and the approval token mechanism (fund-affecting operations require human confirmation).
