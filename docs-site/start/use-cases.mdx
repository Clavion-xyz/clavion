## The core problem

AI agents (ChatGPT, Claude, OpenClaw, etc.) are increasingly capable of *planning* financial actions, but you would never give one your private key. Clavion is the missing layer: **let AI do crypto tasks for you, with guardrails, without exposing your keys.**

## Concrete scenarios

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AI Crypto Assistant" icon="comments">
    Talk in plain English. The agent handles contract calls, gas, and routing. You just approve.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Batch Payments" icon="money-bills">
    Pay multiple contributors in one conversation, one approval. No repetitive wallet interactions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Swap With Guardrails" icon="shield-check">
    Simulate first, enforce slippage caps and value limits. Policy denies hallucinated amounts automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Delegated Access" icon="key">
    Give an AI agent spending limits like a corporate credit card. Allowlists restrict scope.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 1. AI Crypto Assistant -- Talk to Do Transactions

You open OpenClaw and type in plain English:

> "Send 50 USDC to 0xAlice"

The agent figures out the contract, builds the transaction, and Clavion shows you a summary:

```text
Transfer 50 USDC -> 0xAlice
Risk score: 12/100 (low)
[Approve] [Deny]
```

You hit approve, it signs and broadcasts. You never touched a wallet UI, never copy-pasted an address into MetaMask, never worried about gas settings. The agent handled all of that, but your key never left your machine.

<Tip>
This is especially valuable for people who find wallet UIs intimidating or error-prone. The AI handles the technical complexity while Clavion provides the security guardrails.
</Tip>

### 2. Batch Payments

You run a small project and pay 5 contributors monthly in USDC:

> "Pay Alice 500 USDC, Bob 300 USDC, Carol 200 USDC, Dave 150 USDC, Eve 100 USDC"

The agent generates 5 transfer intents. You review a single summary and approve. Without this, you would manually do 5 separate MetaMask transactions, copy-pasting each address and amount -- a process that is slow and error-prone.

### 3. Swap With Guardrails

> "Swap 1000 USDC to ETH on Uniswap"

Clavion simulates the swap first, shows you the expected output and slippage, and flags risk if it is high. The policy engine enforces:

- **Max transaction value** you configured (e.g., $5,000)
- **Slippage cap** (e.g., 1%)
- **Rate limit** (e.g., max 10 txs/hour)

<Warning>
If the agent hallucinates and tries to swap $50,000 instead, the policy engine denies it automatically. The agent literally cannot exceed your configured limits.
</Warning>

### 4. Delegated Access With Spending Limits

You give a trading bot or an AI agent access to operate, but with a policy:

```json
{
  "maxValuePerTx": "5000000000",
  "maxTxPerHour": 5,
  "allowedTokens": ["0xUSDC", "0xWETH"],
  "allowedRecipients": ["0xUniswapRouter"]
}
```

The agent can do swaps between USDC and WETH on Uniswap, up to $5K per transaction, max 5 per hour. It **cannot** send funds to random addresses, touch tokens outside the allowlist, or exceed the rate limit.

<Note>
This is like giving someone a corporate credit card with spending limits -- useful autonomy with real constraints.
</Note>

### 5. Audit Trail for Compliance

Every action the AI took is logged:

```text
[12:01] intent_created: transfer 50 USDC -> 0xAlice (intentId: abc123)
[12:01] policy_evaluated: allow (risk: 12)
[12:01] approval_requested: user prompted
[12:02] approval_granted: token issued
[12:02] tx_signed: 0x...
[12:02] tx_broadcast: hash 0x...
```

If something goes wrong, you have a full forensic trail. For teams or DAOs, this is critical accountability -- who approved what, when, and why.

### 6. Safe Experimentation With DeFi

New to DeFi? Tell the agent:

> "Approve Uniswap to spend 100 USDC, then swap 100 USDC for ETH"

Clavion's preflight simulation runs the transaction against the actual chain state *before* signing. It shows you the expected balance changes:

```text
You will send: 100 USDC
You will receive: ~0.032 ETH
Risk score: 18/100
```

<Tip>
If the simulation reverts (e.g., insufficient balance, bad contract), it tells you **before** you spend gas. This is training wheels for DeFi -- the AI explains what is happening, the system verifies it is safe.
</Tip>

## Why not just use MetaMask?

| Scenario | MetaMask | Clavion + AI Agent |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Send tokens | Manually enter address, amount, gas | "Send 50 USDC to Alice" |
| Batch payments | 5 manual transactions | One conversation, one approval |
| Spending limits | None -- full access always | Configurable policy engine |
| Audit trail | Etherscan only | Full local audit with intent correlation |
| Simulation before signing | Limited | Built-in preflight with risk score |
| AI integration | None | Native -- the whole point |

## Summary

Clavion lets you **talk to an AI to do crypto transactions safely** -- the AI plans, you approve, your keys stay local, and everything has guardrails and an audit trail.
